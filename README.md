First, ensure you have the AWS_PROFILE environment variable set to your desired user.
Linux: export AWS_PROFILE=<your aws profile>
Windows command prompt for current CMD session: set AWS_PROFILE=<your aws profile>

Then run:
    terraform init

Then run: 
terraform plan -out out.tfplan
This will save the output of the plan to a file and create the workspace in your Terraform organization.
Alternatively, if you want to use an input file to avoid manually inputting values for database_name, database_master_username, vpc_id, and region, run:
terraform plan -var-file input.tfvars -out out.tfplan
where input.tfvars contains values for database_name, database_master_username, vpc_id, and region.

After planning is finished, create the aws infrastructure with
terraform apply out.tfplan
